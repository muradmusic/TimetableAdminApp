The thesis encompasses the analysis, design, implementation, and testing of a prototype application developed to help a departmental timetable administrator manage the covering of classes by teachers. The application features a Spring Boot server and web interfaces for administrators and teachers, developed using Thymeleaf. The thesis starts with a comprehensive analysis of the current process of assigning teachers to classes, covering its main elements, functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and the domain model. In the following chapters, the design and implementation of the prototype app are discussed. The thesis concludes with proposals for future enhancements, derived from the results of user testing. As a result of this thesis, a prototype system is developed that is intended to act as the base platform for future improvements.
